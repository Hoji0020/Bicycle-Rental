1) Used Chat gpt but there was negative values.
2) clipped negative values in data to zero 
3) replaced zeroes with random ints (1-3), those timings are from 1am to 5am, which really have random cyclists. (score= 0.67)
4) replaced zeroes with random ints (1-168), (score= 1.01)
5) replaced zeroes with random ints (1-6), used Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM). (score= 0.662)
6) replaced zeroes with random ints (1-20), used Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM). (score= 0.649)
7) replaced zeroes with random ints (1-40), used Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM). (score= 0.657)
